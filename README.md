## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and provide insights into depression-related discussions on Reddit. The dataset used is `reddit_depression_dataset.csv`, which contains various posts and comments related to depression.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt
````


## Usage

### Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link:

[Download Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antniorodrigues20000/naivebayes-notextcleaning-87-acc#Running-some-experiments-with-a-NaiveBayes-model)

After downloading, place the `reddit_depression_dataset.csv` file in the project directory.

### Training the Model

Before running the application, you need to train the model. Run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```


This script will train the Naive Bayes model using the dataset.

### Running the Application

Once the model is trained, you can run the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Explanation:
- The `README.md` now specifies that the application is a Streamlit app and includes the command `streamlit run app.py` to run it.
- It also includes a command to install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file, which is a common practice for Python projects. Make sure to create this file if it doesn't exist and list all necessary packages.
- Replace placeholders like `yourusername` and `yourproject` with actual information relevant to your project.
